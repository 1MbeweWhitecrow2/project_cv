## Introduction

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate my full-stack development skills by creating a complete application from scratch and deploying it to the cloud. For the frontend, I chose React due to its speed, responsiveness, and interactive capabilities. Django was selected as the backend framework because of my prior experience with Python and the powerful database interaction features provided by Django's ORM. PostgreSQL was chosen as the database because of its excellent performance and strong suitability for handling financial data.

The application is deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker containers.

## Project Goals

* Demonstrate proficiency in full-stack web development.
* Create an application showcasing the ability to handle end-to-end development, from initial planning to cloud deployment.
* Provide a practical example of my analytical and programming skills.

## Functionalities

This application serves as a personal website, presenting essential information about my completed courses, acquired skills, and providing access to various financial charts. Each chart's specific functionalities are described within the corresponding section of the application itself.

The analytical tools presented here represent only a sample of my broader capabilities and are intended to give users an initial insight into my programming skills. Although the project revolves around financial data due to my extensive experience and interest in financial markets, my interests extend broadly into data analysis and data science.

## Limitations

* The financial data used in this application is not real-time; it was collected in the spring of 2025.
* The data provided should not be used as a reference for investment decisions.
* The analytical tools included in this project do not exhaustively represent my programming and analytical capabilities but rather showcase a selected set of skills.
