        <p>

        Welcome to my developer portfolio â€“ not just another resume site.

        This is a real, full-stack web application, built with React, powered by Django, connected to a PostgreSQL database, and deployed on AWS with Docker.

        Why this site? Because certificates can be misleading, and bootcamp diplomas donâ€™t always tell the full story. I wanted to give you something more concrete: a live, working proof of the skills I claim. Every chart, dataset, and feature on this platform was built to showcase my ability to work with real data â€“ from retrieval and processing to analysis and interactive visualization.

        Think of this platform as a technical sandbox â€” a curated sample of what I can do, with code to back it up.

        ðŸ”’ Most features require registration â€” not to harvest your data (I donâ€™t do that) â€” but to keep bots and spam out. Itâ€™s a simple barrier to keep the experience clean.

        So if youâ€™re a recruiter, hiring manager, or just curious â€” sign up, explore the features, check out the code, and see for yourself.

        Let the work speak.
